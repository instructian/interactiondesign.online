      Interaction design is a process in which designers focus on creating engaging web interfaces with logical and thought out behaviors and actions. Successful interactive design uses technology and principles of good communication to create desired user experiences.

      Interaction design in terms of websites and apps is something we have been talking about for 10 years or so, but those bigger conversations and much never. One of the best and most cited introductions to the concept was published by Bob Baxley in 2002 in a 12-part series that defined interaction design for web applications.

      “Introducing Interaction Design” breaks the field into five pieces that are still useful and relevant today:

      Human/machine communication is the translation of conversations between the device and user.
      Action/reaction looks at how interactions happen and unfold.
      State ensures that users know what is happening and why in terms of the application.
      Workflow ensures that users know who to use a tool or application and what happens next.
      Malfunction takes into account mistakes that are bound to happen.

      Further, there are certain considerations to keep in mind when creating design interactions. Usability.gov offers basic questions in six different categories that can help shape how the design comes together.

What can a user do with their mouse, finger or stylus to directly interact with the interface?
What commands can a user give to interact with the interface?
What about the appearance gives the user a clue about how it functions?
What information do you provide to let a user know what will happen before they perform an action?
Are there constraints to help prevent errors?
Do error messages provide a way for the user to correct the problem?
What feedback does a user get when an action is performed?
What is the response time between an action and response?
Are the interface elements a reasonable size to interact with?
Are edges and corners strategically being used to locate interactive elements?
Are you following standards?
Is information chunked into a few items at a time?
Is the user end as simple as possible?
Are familiar formats used?
